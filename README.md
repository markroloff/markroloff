### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mark Roloff, an Azure cloud engineer that loves exploring new ways to let automation do the hard work for me.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
  - A total revamp of my education and training. You see, I burned out for a while, which led to a period of low-growth. Time to change that.
  - A place to start blogging about the items I plan on learning below.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
  - Using AzDO YAML pipelines to deploy to IIS, which will lead to progressively more complex solutions
  - Terraform to handle the infrastructure around the labs that I create
  
My intent is to blog about the scenarios that I create, my solutions to those scenarios, put those solutions into as much code as I can, and to freely share it all here.

I'm just getting this journey started, so bare with me while I work on getting content together.

- âš¡ Fun facts about me: ...
  - I have an unhealthy predilection for :coffee:
  - :cat:s rule, :dog:s drool
  - I :metal: post-rock/metal
  - I love sci-fi :vulcan_salute:, especially the classics by Asimov, Clarke, and Heinlein.
